# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Yelp-Reviews---Natural-Language-Processing

In this notebook, I use natural language processing and sentiment analysis to predict whether yelp reviews are positive or negative. The basic steps of this project are as follows:

1. Load in the data
2. Do some basic EDA
3. Clean, process, and vectorize the text
4. Produce Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models
5. Compare the models' performances

The data was originally provided by Yelp to promote a public dataset challenge, and I found it on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset)
